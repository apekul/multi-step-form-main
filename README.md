# Multi-step Form - Frontend Mentor Challenge

![Design preview for the Multi-step form coding challenge](./src/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Multi-step Form Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). The challenge is to build a multi-step form that looks as close to the design as possible. The form allows users to complete each step of the sequence, go back to a previous step to update their selections, see a summary of their selections on the final step, and confirm their order. It is responsive and includes form validation for missing fields, incorrect email format, and unselected options.


## The Challenge

Users should be able to:
- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
